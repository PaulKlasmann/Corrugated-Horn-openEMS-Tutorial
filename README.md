# Corrugated-Horn-openEMS-Tutorial
A tutorial showing how to generate a range of corrugated horn antennas with Octave/Matlab and then to simulate with the openEMS FDTD simulator.

This project contains 3 files.
1) A Comprehensive Corrugated Horn Generator and Simulation with openEMS.pdf is the tutorial document.
2) Corrugated_horn_with_mode_converter_options_MASTER.m is the main script file.
3) plotFFcocx.m is a function to calculate the radiated cross polar radiation patterns as per the Ludwig3 definition.  This should be copied into the openEMS/matlab folder that contains the functions/scripts used by openEMS.
